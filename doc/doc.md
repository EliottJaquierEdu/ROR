## Inheritance :
Use this technique :
https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Inheritance.html

As suggested by Mr. Ithurbide, we use inheritance to have different types of users instead of composition.

Using this technique, we can have a single table for all the users, and have a type column that will tell you what type of user it is.

If a field is only used by a specific type of user, you can add a condition to the migration to only add the field if the type is correct :
```ruby
add_column :people, :iban, :string, if: "type = 'Teacher'"
```
Teacher inheritance in model :
```ruby
class Teacher < Person
  validates :iban, presence: true
end
```
## Models / schema modifications
### Rename class to school_class
We renamed the class model to school_class to avoid conflicts with the reserved keyword class.
### Remove propotions_asserts
We removed the propotions_asserts table because it was not useful for the project. 
It was used to store which ruby functions to call to know if a student passed but we decided to store this information in the student model (more related to business logic).
## Authentification

Used the default recommended authentification system ([Device](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise)) by [Rails](https://rubygems.org/gems/devise) :

Which approach to choose between *Add authentication to the people table* and *Create a separate users table for authentication*?
- If all people are authenticated users → add Devise to people.
- If some people don't have access / we need a scalable, modular architecture → separate users and people.

Because everyone in the application must be able to log in / people are closely linked to the authentication system, we chose to **add authentication to the people table**.
